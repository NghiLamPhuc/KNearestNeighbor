Implement Basic K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.

Calculating Euclidean distance from new Point to datasets point.

Sort ascending distance, get top k to calculate percent to classify.

In this GUI:

Firststep: training word2vec model with datasets has list of sentences seperated by newline.

Then, predict new sentence.
